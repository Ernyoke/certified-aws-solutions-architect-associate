# AWS Kinesis

- Kinesis is a managed alternative to Apache Kafka
- It is a big data stream tool, which allows to stream application logs, metrics, IoT data, click streams, etc.
- Compatible with many streaming frameworks (Spark, NiFi, etc.)
- Data is automatically replicated to 3 AZ
- Kineses offers 3 types of products:
    - **Kinesis Streams**: low latency streaming ingest at scale
    - **Kinesis Analytics**: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
    - **Kinesis Firehose**: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch

## Kinesis Streams Overview

- Streams are divided in ordered Shards/Partitions
- For higher throughput we can increase the size of the shards
- Data retention is 1 day by default, can go up to 365 days
- Kinesis Streams provides the ability to reprocess/replay the data
- Multiple applications can consume the same stream, this enables real-time processing with scale of throughput
- Kinesis is not a database, once the data is inserted, it can not be deleted

### Kinesis Stream Shards

- One stream is made of many different shards
- 1MB/s or 1000 messages at write PER SHARD
- 2MB/s read PER SHARD
- Billing is done per shard provisioned, we can have a many shards as we want as long as we accept the cost
- Ability to batch the messages per calls
- The number of shards can evolve over time (reshard/merge)
- **Records are ordered per shard!**

### Kinesis Streams API - Put Records

- Data must be sent form the PutRecords API to a partition key
- Data with the same key goes to the same partition (helps with ordering for a specific key)
- Messages sent get a sequence number
- Partition key must be highly distributed in order to avoid hot partitions
- In order to reduce costs, we can use batching with PutRecords API
- It the limits are reached, we get a *ProvisionedThroughputException*

### Exceptions

- ProvisionedThroughputException Exceptions:
    - Happens when the data value exceeds the limit exposed by the shard
    - In order to avoid the, we have to make sure we don't have hot partitions
    - Solutions:
        - Retry with back-off
        - Increase shards (scaling)
        - Ensure the partition key is good

### Consumers

- Consumers can use CLI or SDK, or the Kinesis Client Library (in Java, Node, Python, Ruby, .Net)
- Kinesis Client Library (KCL) uses DynamoDB to checkpoint offsets
- KCL uses DynamoDB to track other workers and share work amongst shards

### Security

- Control access / authorization using IAM policies
- Encryption in flight using HTTPS endpoints
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Possibility to encrypt/decrypt data client side
- VPC Endpoints available for Kinesis to be access within VPCs

## Kinesis Data Firehose

- Fully managed service, no administration required, provides automatic scaling, it is basically serverless
- Used for load data into Redshift, S3, ElasticSearch and Splunk
- It is **Near Real Time**: 60 seconds latency minimum for non full batches or minimum 32 MB of data at a time
- Supports many data formats, conversions, transformation and compression
- Pay for the amount of data going through Firehose

### Kinesis Data Streams vs Firehose

- Streams:
    - Requires to write custom code (producer/consumer)
    - Real time (~200 ms)
    - Must manage scaling (shard splitting / merging)
    - Can store data into stream, data can be stored from 1 to 7 days
    - Data can be read by multiple consumers
- Firehose:
    - Fully managed, sends data to S3, Redshift, Splunk, ElasticSearch
    - Serverless, data transformation can be done with Lambda
    - Near real time
    - Scales automatically
    - It provides no data storage

## Kinesis Data Analytics

- Can take data from Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Firehose and perform some queries on it
- It can perform real-time analytics using SQL
- Kinesis Data Analytics properties:
    - Automatically scales
    - Managed: no servers to provision
    - Continuous: analytics are done in real time
- Pricing: pay per consumption rate
- It can create streams out of real-time queries

## Data Ordering with Kinesis

- Data with the same partition key goes to the same shard
- Data is ordered per shard

## SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis

- SQS:
    - Consumers pull data
    - Data is deleted after being consumed
    - Can have many consumers as we want
    - No need to provision throughput
    - No ordering guarantee in case of standard queues
    - Capability to delay individual messages
- SNS:
    - Pub/Sub: publish data to many subscribers
    - We can have up to 10 million subscribers per topic
    - Data is not persisted (it is lost if not delivered)
    - Up to 10k topics per account
    - No need to provision throughput
    - Integrates with SQS for fan-out architecture
- Kinesis Data Streams:
    - Consumers "pull data"
    - We can have as many consumers as we want
    - Possibility to replay data
    - Recommended for real-time big data analytics and ETL
    - Ordering happens at the shard level
    - Data expires after X days
    - Must provision throughput
